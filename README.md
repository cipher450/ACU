All features & functions:

- Supports file & string hashing
- Drag and drop support (drag a file or folder into Advanced Checksum Utility 3.0, and it will automatically add it)
- Supports multiple hashing algorithms (MD5, SHA1, SHA512, CRC32, RIPEMD-160)
- Hash verifying (check the hashes with the corresponding file to ensure the integrity of the file is correct)
- Running process hashing (Add running processes to get their hash)
- File information (You can get information about any file in the list and save it)

- Portable tool (requires no installation)
- 32-bit and 64-bit support
- Supports multiple languages (English & French)
- Generate a checksum file (Create a checksum file supported formats are *.sfv, *.md5, *.sha1)
- Verify checksum from checksum file (.sfv, .md5, .sha1) (not stable)
- Wordlist hashing (hashing a wordlist)
- Dark theme
- Save file icon
- Advanced file information (Get deep information of .exe or .sys file)
- HMAC (SHA1, SHA512, MD5, RIPEMD160)
